# Employee Tracker (Content Management System)
This command-line application manages a company's employees using node, inquirer, and MySQL.


## Getting Started
You need to set up your MySQL database before you can run the code. 

    1. Download and unzip the code, and install the prerequisites, as explained in the "Installing" section of this README.
    2. In your "employee-tracker-master" directory there is a "db" directory. In that directory there are two files: cms.sql and seed.sql. 
        a. Open your MySQL Workbench and run cms.sql to create the database and tables.
        b. Then run seed.sql to populate the database with some data. (Bonus points if you recognize the people in your database.)
    3. Now that your database is ready to be queried, open index.js and enter your MySQL root password on line 9.
    4. Open a Git terminal. Type "node index.js".

### Prerequisites
  * Git terminal
  * Node
  * MySQL and MySQL Workbench (or the terminal instead of MySQL Workbench)

### Manual tests
    1. "View all employees"
    2. "View all employees by department"
    3. "View all roles"
    4. "View all departments"
    5. "Add department" followed by "View all departments" to confirm that the new department is there.
    6. "Add employee" followed by "View all employees" to confirm that the new employee is there. 
    7. "Add role" followed by "View all roles" to confirm.
    8. "Remove employee" followed by "View all employees" to confirm.
    9. "Update employee role" followed by "View all employees" to confirm.
